# Transactions_Monitoring
In this project a demo of a complete transactions monitoring cycle is created. This code generates synthetic data to generate customer, account, watchlist  , transactions, country risk , etc. datasets.
In the next step 6 senario triggering function is created to generate violation_id for each customer.
in the post detection system based on some thereshold alerts are aggregated and the illicit transactions are assigned alert_id.
then the case managment system assigned case_id to each case also if a case must be created for a customer that already had another case_ID in the last 3 month the same case_id will be assinged to it.
+
data enrichment and ML algorithm is also developed to enhance monitoring capabilities.
